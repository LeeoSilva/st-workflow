[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mst  [22mdriver provides the interface to a variety of SCSI tape devices.  Currently, the driver takes control of all detected
       devices of type ‚Äúsequential-access‚Äù.  The [1mst [22mdriver uses major device number 9.

       Each device uses eight minor device numbers.  The lowermost five bits in the minor numbers are assigned  sequentially  in  the
       order of detection.  In the 2.6 kernel, the bits above the eight lowermost bits are concatenated to the five lowermost bits to
       form the tape number.  The minor numbers can be grouped into two sets of  four  numbers:  the  principal  (auto-rewind)  minor
       device  numbers,  [4mn[24m,  and the ‚Äúno-rewind‚Äù device numbers, ([4mn[24m + 128).  Devices opened using the principal device number will be
       sent a [1mREWIND [22mcommand when they are closed.  Devices opened using the ‚Äúno-rewind‚Äù device number will not.  (Note that using an
       auto-rewind  device  for  positioning the tape with, for instance, mt does not lead to the desired result: the tape is rewound
       after the mt command and the next command starts from the beginning of the tape).

       Within each group, four minor numbers are available to define devices with different characteristics (block size, compression,
       density, etc.)  When the system starts up, only the first device is available.  The other three are activated when the default
       characteristics are defined (see below).  (By changing compile-time constants, it is possible to change  the  balance  between
       the maximum number of tape drives and the number of minor numbers for each drive.  The default allocation allows control of 32
       tape drives.  For instance, it is possible to control up to 64 tape drives with two minor numbers for different options.)

       Devices are typically created by:

           mknod -m 666 /dev/st0 c 9 0
           mknod -m 666 /dev/st0l c 9 32
           mknod -m 666 /dev/st0m c 9 64
           mknod -m 666 /dev/st0a c 9 96
           mknod -m 666 /dev/nst0 c 9 128
           mknod -m 666 /dev/nst0l c 9 160
           mknod -m 666 /dev/nst0m c 9 192
           mknod -m 666 /dev/nst0a c 9 224

       There is no corresponding block device.

       The driver uses an internal buffer that has to be large enough to hold at least one tape block.  In  kernels  before  2.1.121,
       the  buffer  is  allocated  as one contiguous block.  This limits the block size to the largest contiguous block of memory the
       kernel allocator can provide.  The limit is currently 128 kB for 32-bit architectures and 256 kB for 64-bit architectures.  In
       newer  kernels  the driver allocates the buffer in several parts if necessary.  By default, the maximum number of parts is 16.
       This means that the maximum block size is very large (2 MB if allocation of 16 blocks of 128 kB succeeds).

       The driver's internal buffer size is determined by a compile-time constant which can  be  overridden  with  a  kernel  startup
       option.   In addition to this, the driver tries to allocate a larger temporary buffer at run time if necessary.  However, run-
       time allocation of large contiguous blocks of memory may fail and it is advisable not to rely too much on dynamic buffer allo‚Äê
       cation with kernels older than 2.1.121 (this applies also to demand-loading the driver with kerneld or kmod).

       The  driver  does  not  specifically support any tape drive brand or model.  After system start-up the tape device options are
       defined by the drive firmware.  For example, if the drive firmware selects fixed-block mode, the tape device uses  fixed-block
       mode.   The  options  can be changed with explicit [1mioctl[22m(2) calls and remain in effect when the device is closed and reopened.
       Setting the options affects both the auto-rewind and the nonrewind device.

       Different options can be specified for the different devices within the subgroup of four.  The options take  effect  when  the
       device  is opened.  For example, the system administrator can define one device that writes in fixed-block mode with a certain
       block size, and one which writes in variable-block mode (if the drive supports both modes).

       The driver supports [1mtape partitions [22mif they are supported by the drive.  (Note that the tape partitions  have  nothing  to  do
       with  disk  partitions.  A partitioned tape can be seen as several logical tapes within one medium.)  Partition support has to
       be enabled with an [1mioctl[22m(2).  The tape location is preserved within each partition across partition  changes.   The  partition
       used  for  subsequent  tape  operations is selected with an [1mioctl[22m(2).  The partition switch is executed together with the next
       tape operation in order to avoid unnecessary tape movement.  The maximum number of partitions on a tape is defined by  a  com‚Äê
       pile-time  constant  (originally  four).  The driver contains an [1mioctl[22m(2) that can format a tape with either one or two parti‚Äê
       tions.

       Device [4m/dev/tape[24m is usually created as a hard or soft link to the default tape device on the system.

       Starting from kernel 2.6.2, the driver exports in the sysfs directory  [4m/sys/class/scsi_tape[24m  the  attached  devices  and  some
       parameters assigned to the devices.

   [1mData transfer[0m
       The  driver  supports  operation in both fixed-block mode and variable-block mode (if supported by the drive).  In fixed-block
       mode the drive writes blocks of the specified size and the block size is not dependent on the byte counts of the write  system
       calls.   In  variable-block  mode  one tape block is written for each write call and the byte count determines the size of the
       corresponding tape block.  Note that the blocks on the tape don't contain any information about the writing mode:  when  read‚Äê
       ing, the only important thing is to use commands that accept the block sizes on the tape.

       In  variable-block  mode  the read byte count does not have to match the tape block size exactly.  If the byte count is larger
       than the next block on tape, the driver returns the data and the function returns the actual block size.  If the block size is
       larger than the byte count, an error is returned.

       In  fixed-block  mode  the  read byte counts can be arbitrary if buffering is enabled, or a multiple of the tape block size if
       buffering is disabled.  Kernels before 2.1.121 allow writes with arbitrary byte count if buffering is enabled.  In  all  other
       cases  (kernel  before  2.1.121  with  buffering disabled or newer kernel) the write byte count must be a multiple of the tape
       block size.

       In the 2.6 kernel, the driver tries to use direct transfers between the user buffer and the device.  If this is not  possible,
       the  driver's internal buffer is used.  The reasons for not using direct transfers include improper alignment of the user buf‚Äê
       fer (default is 512 bytes but this can be changed by the HBA driver), one or more pages of the user buffer  not  reachable  by
       the SCSI adapter, and so on.

       A filemark is automatically written to tape if the last tape operation before close was a write.

       When a filemark is encountered while reading, the following happens.  If there are data remaining in the buffer when the file‚Äê
       mark is found, the buffered data is returned.  The next read returns zero bytes.  The following read  returns  data  from  the
       next  file.   The  end  of  recorded  data is signaled by returning zero bytes for two consecutive read calls.  The third read
       returns an error.

   [1mIoctls[0m
       The driver supports three [1mioctl[22m(2) requests.  Requests not recognized by the [1mst [22mdriver are passed to  the  [1mSCSI  [22mdriver.   The
       definitions below are from [4m/usr/include/linux/mtio.h[24m:

   [1mMTIOCTOP ‚Äî perform a tape operation[0m
       This  request  takes  an  argument of type [4m(struct[24m [4mmtop[24m [4m*)[24m.  Not all drives support all operations.  The driver returns an [1mEIO[0m
       error if the drive rejects an operation.

           /* Structure for MTIOCTOP - mag tape op command: */
           struct mtop {

               int     mt_count;    /* how many of them */
           };

                     kernel version 4.6, a negative [4mmt_count[24m specifies the size of partition 0 and the rest of the tape contains par‚Äê
                     tition 1.  The physical ordering of partitions depends on the drive.  This command is not allowed  for  a  drive
                     unless the partition support is enabled for the drive (see [1mMT_ST_CAN_PARTITIONS [22mbelow).

                     Viper,  Wangtek,  ...).   The block number should be one that was previously returned by [1mMTIOCPOS [22mif device-spe‚Äê

       Magnetic Tape operations for setting of device options (by the superuser):

       [1mMTSETDRVBUFFER[0m
               Set  various  drive  and driver options according to bits encoded in [4mmt_count[24m.  These consist of the drive's buffering
               mode, a set of Boolean driver options, the buffer write threshold, defaults for the block size and density, and  time‚Äê
               outs  (only  in  kernels  2.1 and later).  A single operation can affect only one item in the list above (the Booleans
               counted as one item.)

               A value having zeros in the high-order 4 bits will be used to set the drive's buffering  mode.   The  buffering  modes
               are:

                   0   The  drive  will  not  report  [1mGOOD [22mstatus on write commands until the data blocks are actually written to the
                       medium.

                   1   The drive may report [1mGOOD [22mstatus on write commands as soon as all the data has been transferred to the drive's
                       internal buffer.

                   2   The  drive  may  report  [1mGOOD [22mstatus on write commands as soon as (a) all the data has been transferred to the
                       drive's internal buffer, and (b) all buffered data from different initiators has been successfully written  to
                       the medium.

               To control the write threshold the value in [4mmt_count[24m must include the constant [1mMT_ST_WRITE_THRESHOLD [22mbitwise ORed with
               a block count in the low 28 bits.  The block count refers to 1024-byte blocks, not the  physical  block  size  on  the
               tape.  The threshold cannot exceed the driver's internal buffer size (see DESCRIPTION, above).

               To  set  and  clear  the  Boolean  options  the  value  in  [4mmt_count[24m must include one of the constants [1mMT_ST_BOOLEANS[22m,
               [1mMT_ST_SETBOOLEANS[22m, [1mMT_ST_CLEARBOOLEANS[22m, or [1mMT_ST_DEFBOOLEANS [22mbitwise ORed with whatever combination of  the  following
               options  is  desired.   Using  [1mMT_ST_BOOLEANS  [22mthe options can be set to the values defined in the corresponding bits.
               With [1mMT_ST_SETBOOLEANS [22mthe options can be selectively set and with [1mMT_ST_DEFBOOLEANS [22mselectively cleared.

               The default options for a tape device are set with [1mMT_ST_DEFBOOLEANS[22m.  A nonactive  tape  device  (e.g.,  device  with
               minor  32 or 160) is activated when the default options for it are defined the first time.  An activated device inher‚Äê
               its from the device activated at start-up the options not set explicitly.

               The Boolean options are:

               [1mMT_ST_BUFFER_WRITES [22m(Default: true)
                      Buffer all write operations in fixed-block mode.  If this option is false and the  drive  uses  a  fixed  block
                      size,  then  all  write  operations must be for a multiple of the block size.  This option must be set false to
                      write reliable multivolume archives.

               [1mMT_ST_ASYNC_WRITES [22m(Default: true)
                      When this option is true, write operations return immediately without waiting for the data to be transferred to
                      the  drive  if the data fits into the driver's buffer.  The write threshold determines how full the buffer must
                      be before a new SCSI write command is issued.  Any errors reported by the drive will be  held  until  the  next
                      operation.  This option must be set false to write reliable multivolume archives.

               [1mMT_ST_READ_AHEAD [22m(Default: true)
                      This  option causes the driver to provide read buffering and read-ahead in fixed-block mode.  If this option is
                      false and the drive uses a fixed block size, then all read operations must be for a multiple of the block size.

               [1mMT_ST_TWO_FM [22m(Default: false)
                      This option modifies the driver behavior when a file is closed.  The normal action is to write a  single  file‚Äê
                      mark.  If the option is true, the driver will write two filemarks and backspace over the second one.

                      Note:  This  option  should  not be set true for QIC tape drives since they are unable to overwrite a filemark.
                      These drives detect the end of recorded data by testing for blank tape rather than two  consecutive  filemarks.
                      Most  other  current  drives  also detect the end of recorded data and using two filemarks is usually necessary
                      only when interchanging tapes with some other systems.

               [1mMT_ST_DEBUGGING [22m(Default: false)
                      This option turns on various debugging messages from the driver (effective only if the driver was compiled with
                      [1mDEBUG [22mdefined nonzero).

               [1mMT_ST_FAST_EOM [22m(Default: false)
                      This  option causes the [1mMTEOM [22moperation to be sent directly to the drive, potentially speeding up the operation
                      but causing the driver to lose track of the current file number normally returned by the [1mMTIOCGET [22mrequest.   If
                      [1mMT_ST_FAST_EOM [22mis false, the driver will respond to an [1mMTEOM [22mrequest by forward spacing over files.

               [1mMT_ST_AUTO_LOCK [22m(Default: false)
                      When this option is true, the drive door is locked when the device is opened and unlocked when it is closed.

               [1mMT_ST_DEF_WRITES [22m(Default: false)
                      The  tape  options  (block  size, mode, compression, etc.) may change when changing from one device linked to a
                      drive to another device linked to the same drive depending on how the devices are defined.  This option defines
                      when the changes are enforced by the driver using SCSI-commands and when the drives auto-detection capabilities
                      are relied upon.  If this option is false, the driver sends the SCSI-commands immediately when  the  device  is
                      changed.   If the option is true, the SCSI-commands are not sent until a write is requested.  In this case, the
                      drive firmware is allowed to detect the tape structure when reading and the SCSI-commands are used only to make
                      sure that a tape is written according to the correct specification.

               [1mMT_ST_CAN_BSR [22m(Default: false)
                      When  read-ahead is used, the tape must sometimes be spaced backward to the correct position when the device is
                      closed and the SCSI command to space backward over records is used for this purpose.  Some older  drives  can't
                      process  this  command reliably and this option can be used to instruct the driver not to use the command.  The
                      end result is that, with read-ahead and fixed-block mode, the tape may not be  correctly  positioned  within  a
                      file when the device is closed.  With 2.6 kernel, the default is true for drives supporting SCSI-3.

               [1mMT_ST_NO_BLKLIMS [22m(Default: false)
                      Some drives don't accept the [1mREAD BLOCK LIMITS [22mSCSI command.  If this is used, the driver does not use the com‚Äê
                      mand.  The drawback is that the driver can't check before sending  commands  if  the  selected  block  size  is
                      acceptable to the drive.

               [1mMT_ST_CAN_PARTITIONS [22m(Default: false)
                      This  option enables support for several partitions within a tape.  The option applies to all devices linked to
                      a drive.

               [1mMT_ST_SCSI2LOGICAL [22m(Default: false)
                      This option instructs the driver to use the logical block addresses defined in the SCSI-2  standard  when  per‚Äê
                      forming the seek and tell operations (both with [1mMTSEEK [22mand [1mMTIOCPOS [22mcommands and when changing tape partition).
                      Otherwise, the device-specific addresses are used.  It is highly advisable to set this option if the drive sup‚Äê
                      ports  the  logical  addresses  because they count also filemarks.  There are some drives that support only the
                      logical block addresses.

               [1mMT_ST_SYSV [22m(Default: false)
                      When this option is enabled, the tape devices use the SystemV semantics.   Otherwise,  the  BSD  semantics  are
                      used.   The  most  important difference between the semantics is what happens when a device used for reading is
                      closed: in System V semantics the tape is spaced forward past the next filemark if this has not happened  while
                      using the device.  In BSD semantics the tape position is not changed.

               [1mMT_NO_WAIT [22m(Default: false)
                      Enables immediate mode (i.e., don't wait for the command to finish) for some commands (e.g., rewind).

               An example:

                   struct mtop mt_cmd;
                   mt_cmd.mt_op = MTSETDRVBUFFER;
                   mt_cmd.mt_count = MT_ST_BOOLEANS |
                           MT_ST_BUFFER_WRITES | MT_ST_ASYNC_WRITES;
                   ioctl(fd, MTIOCTOP, mt_cmd);

               The  default  block  size  for a device can be set with [1mMT_ST_DEF_BLKSIZE [22mand the default density code can be set with
               [1mMT_ST_DEFDENSITY[22m.  The values for the parameters are or'ed with the operation code.

               With kernels 2.1.x and later, the timeout values can be set with the subcommand [1mMT_ST_SET_TIMEOUT [22mORed with the  time‚Äê
               out  in  seconds.   The  long  timeout (used for rewinds and other commands that may take a long time) can be set with
               [1mMT_ST_SET_LONG_TIMEOUT[22m.  The kernel defaults are very long to make sure that a successful command  is  not  timed  out
               with  any  drive.   Because of this, the driver may seem stuck even if it is only waiting for the timeout.  These com‚Äê
               mands can be used to set more practical values for a specific drive.  The timeouts set for one device  apply  for  all
               devices linked to the same drive.

               Starting  from  kernels 2.4.19 and 2.5.43, the driver supports a status bit which indicates whether the drive requests
               cleaning.  The method used by the drive to return cleaning information is set using the [1mMT_ST_SEL_CLN [22msubcommand.   If
               the  value  is  zero,  the cleaning bit is always zero.  If the value is one, the TapeAlert data defined in the SCSI-3
               standard is used (not yet implemented).  Values 2‚Äì17 are reserved.  If the lowest eight bits are >= 18, bits from  the
               extended  sense  data are used.  The bits 9‚Äì16 specify a mask to select the bits to look at and the bits 17‚Äì23 specify
               the bit pattern to look for.  If the bit pattern is zero, one or more  bits  under  the  mask  indicate  the  cleaning
               request.  If the pattern is nonzero, the pattern must match the masked sense data byte.

       [4mmt_type[24m    The  header  file defines many values for [4mmt_type[24m, but the current driver reports only the generic types [1mMT_ISSCSI1[0m
                  (Generic SCSI-1 tape) and [1mMT_ISSCSI2 [22m(Generic SCSI-2 tape).

       [4mmt_resid[24m   contains the current tape partition number.

       [4mmt_dsreg[24m   reports the drive's current settings for block size (in the low 24 bits) and density (in the high 8  bits).   These
                  fields are defined by [1mMT_ST_BLKSIZE_SHIFT[22m, [1mMT_ST_BLKSIZE_MASK[22m, [1mMT_ST_DENSITY_SHIFT[22m, and [1mMT_ST_DENSITY_MASK[22m.

       [4mmt_gstat[24m   reports  generic  (device independent) status information.  The header file defines macros for testing these status
                  bits:

                  [1mGMT_EOF[22m([4mx[24m): The tape is positioned just after a filemark (always false after an [1mMTSEEK [22moperation).

                  [1mGMT_BOT[22m([4mx[24m): The tape is positioned at the beginning of the first file (always false after an [1mMTSEEK [22moperation).

                  [1mGMT_EOT[22m([4mx[24m): A tape operation has reached the physical End Of Tape.

                  [1mGMT_SM[22m([4mx[24m): The tape is currently positioned at a setmark (always false after an [1mMTSEEK [22moperation).

                  [1mGMT_EOD[22m([4mx[24m): The tape is positioned at the end of recorded data.

                  [1mGMT_WR_PROT[22m([4mx[24m): The drive is write-protected.  For some drives this can also mean that the drive does  not  support
                      writing on the current medium type.

                  [1mGMT_ONLINE[22m([4mx[24m): The last [1mopen[22m(2) found the drive with a tape in place and ready for operation.

                      for 9-track ¬Ω" tape drives only.

                  [1mGMT_DR_OPEN[22m([4mx[24m): The drive does not have a tape in place.

                      cally  written  to  the  tape when the write call returns.  It is set zero only when the driver does not buffer
                      data and the drive is set not to buffer data.

                  [1mGMT_CLN[22m([4mx[24m): The drive has requested cleaning.  Implemented in kernels since 2.4.19 and 2.5.43.

       [4mmt_erreg[24m   The only field defined in [4mmt_erreg[24m is the recovered error count in the low  16  bits  (as  defined  by  [1mMT_ST_SOFT‚Äê[0m
                  [1mERR_SHIFT  [22mand [1mMT_ST_SOFTERR_MASK[22m.  Due to inconsistencies in the way drives report recovered errors, this count is
                  often not maintained (most drives do not by default report soft errors but this can be changed  with  a  SCSI  MODE
                  SELECT command).

       [4mmt_fileno[24m  reports the current file number (zero-based).  This value is set to -1 when the file number is unknown (e.g., after
                  [1mMTBSS [22mor [1mMTSEEK[22m).

       [4mmt_blkno[24m   reports the block number (zero-based) within the current file.  This value is set to -1 when the  block  number  is
                  unknown (e.g., after [1mMTBSF[22m, [1mMTBSS[22m, or [1mMTSEEK[22m).

       This request takes an argument of type [4m(struct[24m [4mmtpos[24m [4m*)[24m and reports the drive's notion of the current tape block number, which
       is not the same as [4mmt_blkno[24m returned by [1mMTIOCGET[22m.  This drive must be a SCSI-2 drive that supports the [1mREAD  POSITION  [22mcommand

[1mNOTES[0m
       1.  When exchanging data between systems, both systems have to agree on the physical tape block size.   The  parameters  of  a
           drive  after  startup  are  often  not the ones most operating systems use with these devices.  Most systems use drives in
           variable-block mode if the drive supports that mode.  This applies to most modern drives, including DATs, 8mm helical scan
           drives,  DLTs,  etc.   It may be advisable to use these drives in variable-block mode also in Linux (i.e., use [1mMTSETBLK [22mor
           [1mMTSETDEFBLK [22mat system startup to set the mode), at least when exchanging data with a foreign system.  The drawback of this
           is that a fairly large tape block size has to be used to get acceptable data transfer rates on the SCSI bus.

       2.  Many programs (e.g., [1mtar[22m(1)) allow the user to specify the blocking factor on the command line.  Note that this determines
           the physical block size on tape only in variable-block mode.

       3.  In order to use SCSI tape drives, the basic SCSI driver, a SCSI-adapter driver and the SCSI tape  driver  must  be  either
           configured  into the kernel or loaded as modules.  If the SCSI-tape driver is not present, the drive is recognized but the
           tape support described in this page is not available.

       4.  The driver writes error messages to the console/log.  The SENSE codes written into some messages are automatically  trans‚Äê
           lated to text if verbose SCSI messages are enabled in kernel configuration.

       5.  The  driver's  internal  buffering  allows  good  throughput in fixed-block mode also with small [1mread[22m(2) and [1mwrite[22m(2) byte
           counts.  With direct transfers this is not possible and may cause a surprise when moving to the 2.6 kernel.  The  solution
           is  to tell the software to use larger transfers (often telling it to use larger blocks).  If this is not possible, direct
           transfers can be disabled.
